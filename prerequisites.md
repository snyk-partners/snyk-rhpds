### Create a Snyk Account and Install the Snyk CLI

1. [Create a Snyk Account](https://app.snyk.io/login?utm_campaign=RHPDS&utm_medium=Partner&utm_source=Red-Hat) for yourself, or use your existing Snyk account. 

2. Visit the Snyk documentation to [Install the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli) and install it on your system. 

3. After installing, verify your installation by running:

### Install Docker on your workstation

You'll need docker tools to build and push container images. 

1. Visit [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and install Docker on your system. 

> This workshop guide uses Docker to build and push container images. If you prefer buildah and skopeo we recommend proficiency with those tools as the workshop guide is written for docker and staff might not be able to support you. 

2. Verify Docker installed correctly.

```sh
docker --version
```

### Create a Quay Account and Repo

1. Create an account or sign in to [Quay.io](https://quay.io).

2. Once signed in, create a Repository on Quay.io. We recommend calling it `goof`.
