<h1>Snyk Demo & Workshop</h1>
<h2>Secure your Containers with Snyk</h2>
<p>
    Snyk empowers developers to easily find and fix vulnerabilities in applications running on OpenShift. This
    workshop guides users through using <a href="https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/">Snyk
        Container</a> and <a href="https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/">Snyk Infrastructure as
        Code</a> to identify and
    remediate security and configuration risks in a sample application deployed into OpenShift.
</p>
<p>
    The RHPDS environment provides each user an OpenShift project with:
<ul>
    <li>A deployment of Snyk's vulnerable <a href="https://github.com/snyk/goof">Goof</a> application</li>
    <li>A fully deployed and running <a

            Controller</a></li>
</ul>
The steps below will cover the following topics:
<ul>
    <li>Reviewing the security and configuration scan results in the Snyk UI, then</li>
    <li>Finding and applying a more secure base image using Snykâ€™s upgrade guidance.</li>
